Repository Test - Let's Program! 

I enjoy programming and feel like my knowledge increases every day. Documenting my progress makes looking back fun. Here I am at GitHub learning even more about coding. The best part is I'm at Disneyland!! I need to find a way to work from wherever instead of in an office. :). I've been learning about my industry at the CUNA Lending Conference, while at the same time learning about the progress of the WY Blockchain Taskforce and programming. Truely living the dream!
